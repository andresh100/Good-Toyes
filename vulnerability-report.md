## Vulnerability Report

### SQL Injection

SQL Injection is when a user tries to inject, commands into a query inorder to gain access to sensitive data in the database. We use Entity Framework, this allows us to avoid writing full SQL statements and to parametrize our queries. 

This will prevent injection by eliminating the JOINS potention data bandits might use to add to LINQ queries.

### Access Control

Access Control will prevent a user from gaining access to restricted part of the application.  A user might gain access through manipulating the url, cookies or tokens.  

Our application is protected from this kind of access because we are using Identity.  By creating policies, meaning only a person that meet a particular contition, have a certain email address for example can have access to a protected area of the application.  We can use [Authorize] to restrice, View Classes and Methods.
