## Vulnerability Report

### SQL Injection

SQL Injection is when a user tries to inject, commands into a query inorder to gain access to sensitive data in the database. They do this by adding to the search criteria or by changing the placeholder used in the search. We use Entity Framework, this allows us to avoid writing full SQL statements and to parametrize our queries. 

This will prevent injection by eliminating the JOINS potential data bandits might use to add to LINQ queries.  We aslo do not use concatenated string in our Database queries, and try to use only ints, in our queries. 

### Here is a good example of Vulnerable code

### Access Control

Access Control will prevent a user from gaining access to restricted part of the application.  A user might gain access through manipulating the url, cookies or tokens. We want to prevent this access because a user might be able to gain access to an inventory control for example, and cause major damage to a store. 

Our application is protected from this kind of access because we are using Identity.  By creating policies, meaning only a person that meet a particular contition, have a certain email address for example can have access to a protected area of the application.  We can use [Authorize] to restrice, View Classes and Methods.

### Here is an code example of using [Authorize] tage to limit access to users who have met the criteria of the policy

### Sensitive Data Exposure

Exposing sensitive data publicly places all of your users at risk. A strong TLS 1.2 policy should be implemented sitewide, and SSL should be replaced if present. SSL exposes your applications to a variety of types of attack, such as DROWN and POODLE attacks. TLS v1.2 should be your main protocol because it's the only version that offers modern authenticated encryption.

Since we are utilizing TLS 1.2 in our application, our users are protected from any unauthorized and/or malicious access to sensitive information. Free TLS certifications can be obtained <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">here</a>.

### Here is an example of how to redirect HTTPS in your Startup class in order to ensure SSL is not in use

### Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

It is critical to update components as updates become available in stable form. This means keeping your frameworks and NuGet packages current whenever you can, as many will contain their own vulnerabilities.
