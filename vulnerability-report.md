### SQL Injection

SQL Injection is when a user tries to inject, commands into a query inorder to gain access to sensitive data in the database. We use Entity Framework, this allows us to avoid writing full SQL statements and to parametrize our queries. This will prevent injection by eliminating the JOINS potention data bandits might use to add to LINQ queries.
